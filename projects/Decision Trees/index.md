# Project: Decision Trees

This project builds decision tree classifiers and regressors, exploring splitting criteria and pruning.

## Summary

- Goal: Predict classes or continuous values using tree-based models
- Concepts: Gini, entropy, information gain, pruning, max depth
- Pipeline: Preprocessing → Training → Feature importance → Evaluation
