# Project 12: K-Fold Cross Validation

This project demonstrates K-Fold cross validation to assess model generalization and tune hyperparameters.

## Summary

- Goal: Estimate model performance reliably across folds
- Concepts: Stratified K-Fold, shuffle, leakage prevention, scoring metrics
- Pipeline: Split → Train → Validate → Aggregate
