# Project: Gradient Descent (Applied)

This project demonstrates gradient descent and its variants (batch, stochastic, mini-batch) on practical problems.

## Summary

- Goal: Optimize parameters to minimize a cost function
- Concepts: Learning rate, convergence, cost surfaces, updates
- Experiments: Different learning rates, convergence plots

## Notebook

- Rendered notebook: Will appear here once the `.ipynb` is added.
