# Project: Multiclass Logistic Regression

This project implements multiclass classification using softmax regression and one-vs-rest strategies.

## Summary

- Goal: Classify into more than two classes
- Concepts: Softmax, cross-entropy, OvR vs multinomial
- Steps: Preprocess → Train → Evaluate (confusion matrix)
