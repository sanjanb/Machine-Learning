# Project: Logistic Regression

This project applies logistic regression for binary and multiclass classification.

## Summary

- Goal: Classify samples into discrete categories
- Concepts: Sigmoid, decision boundary, one-vs-rest (OvR), softmax (multiclass)
- Pipeline: Preprocessing → Model training → Evaluation (accuracy, precision/recall)

## Notebook

- [Rendered notebook](/Machine-Learning/projects/logistic-regression/notebook)
- Open in Colab: [Launch](/redirect?target=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2Fgithub%2Fsanjanb%2FMachine-Learning%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fprojects%2F7.%2520Logistic%2520Regression%2Flogistic-regression.ipynb)
