# Project: Logistic Regression

This project applies logistic regression for binary and multiclass classification.

## Summary

- Goal: Classify samples into discrete categories
- Concepts: Sigmoid, decision boundary, one-vs-rest (OvR), softmax (multiclass)
- Pipeline: Preprocessing → Model training → Evaluation (accuracy, precision/recall)
