## **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**

* **Libraries:** Uses Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly (for interactive plots) [[01:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=67)].
* **Data Size:** The dataset contains 3,900 rows and 19 columns [[02:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=176)].
* **Cleaning:** The initial steps involve dropping the unnecessary 'Customer ID' column, checking for null values (none found), and dropping duplicates (none found) [[03:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=235)].

## **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Conclusions**

The analysis covers 12 different aspects of customer behavior, with the following conclusions:

| Analysis Point | Key Finding | Conclusion/Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distribution of Age** | Most shoppers belong to the **40–60 age group**, followed by **20–40** [[09:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=555)]. | The mall can offer more discounts or features targeting these two dominant age segments [[11:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=675)]. |
| **Gender Distribution** | **68% of purchases** are made by **males**, while only 32% are made by females [[13:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=826)]. | The mall should target male customers with more offers and investigate why female purchases are low (e.g., quality, variety, facilities) [[14:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=843)]. |
| **Most Commonly Purchased Items** | **Blouses** and **Jewelry** are the most purchased items. **Jeans**, **Gloves**, and **Backpacks** are the least purchased [[18:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1086)]. | Increase variety for highly purchased items and analyze pricing/quality issues for least purchased items [[18:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1112)]. |
| **Season-wise Shopping** | Shopping is maximum during **Spring** and **Fall** seasons [[21:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1279)]. | The mall should stock more clothes/accessories relevant to Spring and Fall during those times [[21:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1303)]. |
| **Location Distribution** | **Montana** Outlet is the most preferred, followed by the **California** Outlet [[24:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1494)]. | Analyze factors contributing to success in Montana/California and implement similar strategies in underperforming locations like Rhode Island and Kansas [[25:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1507)]. |
| **Preferred Payment Method** | **PayPal** and **Credit Card** are the most preferred payment methods, while Bank Transfer is the least [[28:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1684)]. | Increase incentives (cashbacks, facilities) for using preferred methods [[28:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1697)]. |
| **Frequency of Purchases** | Maximum people prefer shopping **"After Every 3 Months"**, followed by "Annually" [[31:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1913)]. | The mall can launch special offers or targeted campaigns every three months [[32:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=1924)]. |
| **Promo Code Usage** | **57% of people shop *without* using a promo code** [[33:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2035)]. | Use targeted promo codes to increase adoption and track customer response [[34:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2050)]. |
| **Shipping Type Distribution** | **Free Shipping** is the most preferred method [[35:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2136)]. | This suggests people are resistant to paying shipping charges [[35:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2148)]. |
| **Average Review Rating (Gender-wise)** | The average rating by **males (3.8)** is slightly higher than by females (3.7) [[38:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2288)]. | This reinforces the need to address female customer satisfaction, as their purchases and ratings are both lower [[38:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2306)]. |
| **Color Preference** | **Olive** and **Yellow** are the most preferred colors [[40:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2446)]. | Increase products in these highly preferred colors and reduce stock of least preferred colors like Red, Peach, and Indigo [[41:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2467)]. |
| **Category by Gender and Payment Method (Sunburst Plot)** | **Overall:** Mostly shopping is done by males. **Clothing** and **Accessories** are the most popular categories for both genders. **Male** preference for payment is **Credit Card**, while **Female** preference is **Venmo** [[45:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2703)]. | These multi-factor insights help in highly targeted marketing and facility management [[47:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaUt-kQO0L8&t=2842)].
