# Machine Learning Notes

Welcome to my personal notes on Machine Learning.  
This site is built using Jekyll and is organized for clean, minimal reading and easy navigation.

## Structure

The notes are organized as follows:

- **Introduction** – Course overview and syllabus
- **Lecture Notes** – Summaries of each lecture
- **Topics** – Detailed write-ups on algorithms and concepts
- **References** – Links, books, and papers
